    The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by,

    1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

    By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its
    alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For
    example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word
    value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

    Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text
    file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are
    triangle words?
